the above vedio is the algorithum for the problem statment - The identification of cryptographic algorithms from encrypted datasets is a critical challenge in cybersecurity. Given a dataset generated using modern cryptographic algorithms, the goal is to analyze the data and determine the encryption algorithm used. This problem requires developing AI/ML-based techniques to recognize patterns, structures, or characteristics unique to different cryptographic algorithms, enabling accurate identification even when the encryption method is unknown.
